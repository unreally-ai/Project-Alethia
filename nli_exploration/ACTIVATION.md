The virtual environment was created with
`python3 -m venv .env`

It can be activated through
```
# Activate the virtual environment
source .env/bin/activate

# Deactivate the virtual environment
source .env/bin/deactivate
```

Or in fish shell 
`set VIRTUAL_ENV "/home/cas/Documents/coding/python/Project-Alethia/nli_exploration/.env"`

And to install datasets via huggingface, you'll need
`pup install datasets`
